# TargetProductMonitor
A python script made for personal use to monitor for sports card resocks on target.com since they are sold out often. When a restock occurs or a product page is loaded, it will send a message through the terminal, and also through a discord webhook. Target does not offer free eduactional api acesss to product data so an in-house script is needed to load and refresh a product page during suspected restocktimes based on patterns of previous restocks. Different versions have been used to work with different packages and libraries.
